This application uses Express.js to set up local servers to create a note taking application so that users will be able to save their notes in a lightweight application.

The challenge of this application was using everything we know about javascript, node and express and combining them into an application that accesses a database and uses that database to create the information on an HTML website.Â 

I was able to use get requests to fetch previously saved notes, the post request to create new notes, an the delete request to delete notes from the database.


You will need to download NPM an also Express to use this application.
